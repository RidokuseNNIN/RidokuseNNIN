# 👋 Hi, I’m Mateo

- 🧱 I’m a construction engineer transitioning into C++ software development.
- 👀 I’m interested in combining engineering logic with modern programming tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced C++ (STL, OOP, Qt, GUI apps) through hands-on projects.
- 💻 I’m building a series of 1000 C++ projects for the construction industry — from calculators to full-featured desktop apps.
- 🛠 My main tools: C++, Qt, Visual Studio, GitHub, CLI and soon: Qt Creator & cross-platform deployment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source civil engineering tools and educational resources.
- 📫 How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/RidokuseNNIN)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use code to do what used to take hours with a calculator 😄
