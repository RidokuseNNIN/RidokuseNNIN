# 👋 Hi, I’m Mateusz

- 🧱 I am a Strucutral engineer/Constrution Manager who enjoys programming in my spare time, in c++ .
- 👀 I’m interested in combining engineering logic with modern programming tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced C++ (STL, OOP, Qt, GUI apps) through hands-on projects.
- 💻 I'm building a series of 1000 C++ projects for the construction industry - from calculators to full-featured desktop applications, in order to learn as well as improve my work.
- 🛠 My main tools: C++,CMake, Qt, Visual Studio, GitHub, CLI and soon: Qt Creator,MFC & cross-platform deployment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source civil engineering tools and educational resources.
- 📫 How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/RidokuseNNIN)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use code to do what used to take hours with a calculator 😄
